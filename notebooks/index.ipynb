    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geowrangler** is a geospatial python package that aims to shorten the workflows in geodata wrangling. Its goal is to solve the problem of having to build time-consuming data transformation workflows with no out-of-the-box solutions from other libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our immediate audience is the AI4D poverty mapping team, with the primary audience being the researchers and engineers delivering geospatial projects as well as other GIS data analysts. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have surveyed insights from past projects and have a pipeline of ongoing and upcoming geospatial projects that require these data transformations and we saw the need to create **Geowrangler** to be able to extract and reuse these solutions we keep encountering in our work."
